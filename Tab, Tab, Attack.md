Description

Using tabcomplete in the Terminal will add years to your life, esp. when dealing with long rambling directory structures and filenames: Addadshashanammu.zip


Hints

After `unzip`ing, this problem can be solved with 11 button-presses...(mostly Tab)...

Steps taken to obtain the flag:

As usual we first have to download the file

Next is unzipping the file in terminal using the command unzip name of folder, after unzipping the file

we just have to cd into the directory, then cd into another directory, then aslo cd into another directory and this goes on until we find a file at the end where we shall execute it uisng the ./ command thus getting the flag as seen below

Note: the Tab command is used to fasten filling in a name of a directory/file,  while in a given directory and wanting to go to another directory one simply has to type in few letters of the folder one want to go into and thus by hitting the Tab command, it fills out the rest of the remianing letters of the folder/file


Lessons learned:

1. Learned to use the Tab command to fasten filling in the names of directories/files
